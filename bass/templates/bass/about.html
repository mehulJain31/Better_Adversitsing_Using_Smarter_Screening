        <h2><strong>What is BASS?</strong></h2><br>
        <p style="font-size:22px">Better Advertising using Smart Screening (BASS) will facilitate and enable smarter efforts in determining a quality social media influencer match for a company trying to advertise products or services. Smart Screening will automate the match making process for companies trying to reach out to potential influencers who best fit the mold of the product or service. Typically, the current process is done manually involving analysts that research into influeners to evaluate margin of profits from utilizing that influencer to post companies' products or services. From the help of data mining, object recognition and our matchmaking algorithm this will enable companies to see more prosperous results through the accuracy and consistent ability to assist them in selecting influencers who fit their mold of what an influencer should fit to. It can be optimized to provide a sophisticated plan to achieve greater results.</p><br>

        <p style="font-size:22px">Influencers would have the ability to advertise products that they have an interest in that would fit the general theme of their profile. This in turn would be beneficial to the influencer who has a follower base that likely has a genuine interest in the things that are posted by the influencer. Although, advertisements in a general sense are not viewed favorably in the slightest, but by posting a relevant advertisement to the influencer’s follower base that is atleast related to the theme of the influencer’s profile would likely draw less negative feedback, such as dislikes or unfollows. Furthermore, an advertisement that is applicable to the influencer and follower base is more likely to be viewed, clicked on and purchased than an advertisement that is unrelated to the theme of the influencer. This will be beneficial for all parties involved because of the increased monetary gain, rise in popularity of the product and influencer, and efficient usage of resources for the advertiser.</p>
